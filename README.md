## üéØ About The Project

In many residential and industrial settings, manual monitoring of water tanks is inefficient and prone to error, leading to potential water shortages or overflows. This project offers a definitive solution by automating the monitoring process. It leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide real-time data on water levels, accessible through a custom dashboard on your phone or web browser.

This system is perfect for:
* üè° **Homeowners:** Monitoring overhead or underground water tanks.
* üåæ **Farmers:** Managing water levels in irrigation tanks.
* üè≠ **Industries:** Keeping track of liquid levels in storage containers.
* üíß **Communities:** Monitoring water reservoirs for public supply.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The architecture of this system is designed for reliability and real-time responsiveness. The diagram below illustrates the complete data flow, from sensor to user interface.

![System Architecture](./image_5a880f.png)
*(Catatan: Diagram ini menggunakan NodeMCU sebagai contoh, namun arsitekturnya identik untuk ESP32. Pastikan Anda telah mengunggah gambar `image_5a880f.png` ke repositori Anda agar gambar ini muncul)*

The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Input (Data Acquisition):** An ultrasonic sensor placed above the water tank (`Tangki Air`) continuously measures the distance to the water's surface.
2.  **Processing:** An **ESP32** microcontroller reads the raw data from the sensor. It then processes this data to calculate the current water level and percentage.
3.  **Connectivity:** The ESP32 connects to a local **Wi-Fi network** to gain internet access, acting as the bridge between the physical hardware and the cloud server.
4.  **Backend & Frontend Server:** The processed data is transmitted over the internet to the **Web Server**. This server hosts both the backend and frontend applications.
    * The **Backend** is responsible for data storage, user authentication, pump control logic, and sending notifications.
    * The **Frontend** provides a user-friendly dashboard for real-time monitoring and interaction.
5.  **Output (User Interface):** The end-user can access the web application from any device with a browser, such as a smartphone or PC. From the dashboard, the user can:
    * View **Real-time Monitoring** data.
    * Perform **Pump Control**.
    * Receive **Notifications** about the tank's status.
    * Review **Data History**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project.

### Prerequisites

* **Hardware:**
    * ESP32 Development Board
    * HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
    * Jumper Wires
    * 5V Power Supply (e.g., USB adapter)
* **Software:**
    * [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed.
    * **ESP32 Board Core:** Install the ESP32 board manager in your Arduino IDE. Follow this [tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/).
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the backend)
    * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or a MongoDB Atlas account)

### Hardware Assembly

Connect the components as described below. It is crucial to ensure all connections are secure for accurate readings.

| HC-SR04 Pin | ESP32 Pin      |
| :---------- | :------------- |
| `VCC`       | `VIN`          |
| `GND`       | `GND`          |
| `Trig`      | `GPIO5`        |
| `Echo`      | `GPIO18`       |

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The HC-SR04 sensor's `Echo` pin outputs a 5V signal, while the ESP32's GPIO pins are only **3.3V tolerant**. For long-term reliability and to prevent damage to your ESP32, it is **highly recommended** to use a simple voltage divider (e.g., a 1kŒ© and a 2kŒ© resistor) to step down the 5V signal to approximately 3.3V before connecting it to the ESP32's `Echo` pin.

### Software Setup & Deployment

#### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd BackEnd

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file and add your configuration
# (see .env.example)
cp .env.example .env

# Run the server
npm run dev
````

#### 2\. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd FrontEnd

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

#### 3\. Firmware (ESP32)

1.  **Open in Arduino IDE:** Open the `.ino` project file from the `Firmware` directory.

2.  **Configure Credentials:** Update the Wi-Fi credentials and the server endpoint in the code.

    ```cpp
    // --- CONFIGURATION ---
    const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
    const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
    const char* server_ip = "YOUR_BACKEND_SERVER_IP";
    const int server_port = 8080;

    const int TANK_HEIGHT_CM = 200; // Total height of your tank
    // ---------------------
    ```

3.  **Upload the Code:**

      * Connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB.
      * In the Arduino IDE, go to `Tools > Board` and select a generic board like **"ESP32 Dev Module"**.
      * Choose the correct COM port under `Tools > Port`.
      * Click the **Upload** button.

4.  **Monitor:**
    Open the Serial Monitor (`Ctrl+Shift+M`) at a baud rate of `115200` (ESP32's default) to see status messages and readings.

## üîß Troubleshooting

  * **No Data on Dashboard:**
      * Ensure the ESP32 is connected to your Wi-Fi (check the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE for logs).
      * Verify that the `server_ip` in the firmware code is correct and accessible from your ESP32's network.
      * Check that the backend server is running and there are no firewall rules blocking the connection.
  * **Inaccurate Readings:**
      * Ensure the sensor is perfectly perpendicular to the water surface.
      * Make sure the `TANK_HEIGHT_CM` constant in the code matches your tank's actual height.
      * Check your voltage divider resistors if the readings are consistently wrong.

-----

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Future Enhancements

  * [ ] **Automated Pump Control:** Implement logic on the backend to automatically control the pump based on user-defined thresholds.
  * [ ] **Solar Power:** Make the system self-sufficient by powering it with a solar panel and a rechargeable battery.
  * [ ] **Data Logging:** Store data locally on an SD card as a backup in case of network failure.
  * [ ] **Enhanced UI:** Develop a custom web application or mobile app for a more tailored user experience.
